	  	the longest music piece
      <br><br>
			In this project I aim to create an algorithmic music piece that last for a long period of time, and present it effectively on a web page.
			The work is thus divided in two major parts: the music piece and the web page.
			The full music piece should be excessively long - in the best case scenario I hope to create a musical structure that varies over a (large!) number of years.
			On the web page itself, the user should have the ability to explore different variations of the piece with ease, and should be able to visualise information to help him understand the full work, and the part he is currently listening to.
			This is meant to be a piece about the longevity of the internet - a medium still in its youth as compared to other historical means of communications, how long will it be until a more convenient system is invented?
			How permanent is this tool we use everyday?
      <br><br>
			By musical structure I mean I that will write a code that generates random music using a set structure of conditions, likely in the form of a melody or just rhythm.
			The code will "explore" the different musical possibilities that its structure offers for a certain period of time (hours or even a day), then the underlying structure will change slightly and a new variation will start. The code will make use of pseudo-random numbers rather than actually random ones. In the p5.js library, noise() is such an object: it can be used to provide always the same infinite array of random numbers. This would allow me to generate parts of the piece without having to save a set structure somewhere. This way the user can go back and explore the same part of the piece twice. In addition, should individual variations all start from the same sequence of random numbers, and only the structure differs, then the user will perhaps be able to compare the differences in the variations. If the piece can be made long enough, it should have a real starting point and the page should always load to what it is "currently" playing based on the time at which the page was loaded. The user could be allowed to scroll backwards in the music piece's timeline, to a time before the internet even existed.
      <br><br>
			This sounds like it could be a big challenge: following through with this idea means a lot of experimentation just to create the music piece. For the purpose of fulfilling the exam requirements however, my priorities will be to implement a functional random musical structure that can repeat over along period of time, and to make the website design. The creation of actually interesting musical material might have to be secondary to a certain extend as I would not want to take away from the web design elements.
      <br><br>
			Nonetheless I've created a starting point for myself to help me decide on this idea. Included in this midterm webpage is a random rhythm generator made with p5.sound.js. It uses a sequence of random numbers in noise() and a weight system which defines a hierarchy within the underlying beat. At each frame, the code pulls the next number from a noise() sequence. Each time a new random number is given, it is given extra "weight" if the frame coincides with a significant part of the rhythmic sctructure (a bar, a beat, a subdivision, etc.). If the value of the random number and weight combined is higher than a certain threshold, a note is fired. This way we can create a random rhythm structured around a given pulsation (whichever part we decide to weight more than the others). We also have a structure that is malleable; by using different weight and threshold values and varying the number of subdivisions we can obtain many different results. noise() is supposed to be infinite, therefor this simple rhythm could already be presented as a piece that lasts an infinite amount of time. Of course this code in its current form doesn't sound too great (it's just a noise synthesizor playing its own rhythm), but I can expand on the idea by adding more complex conditions for weights and by using a similar system to generate melody.
      <br><br>
			As for visual content, I want the webpage to be rather simple. There should be a tool on one side allowing the user to explore specific points within variations of the piece. Provided a long enough piece, it could be a calendar tool or something similar. On the other side, there should be a way to visualize the work. Perhaps a stern graph like the one I made for my proof of concept is a good starting point, but there could be something more abstract and visually appealing instead. In any case it should act to represent time passing; it could also represent the scale of the piece, the actual musical content that is being read, or the current underlying structure. Other than that a title, brief instructions and an about section should be enough.
      <br><br>
			Two inspirations are worth citing for this project: Machine Musicianship by Robert Rowe, and Jonathan Basile's Library of Babel. The first is a book from which I read a few chapters in this last year. Rowe explores the challenges surrounding the implementation of music theory principles in code and demonstrates different approaches to doing so. Though I've yet to explore it again in the light of this project, I must cite this book because the weighting system I describe above is a concept derived from my memory of reading Rowe. There are many weighting systems described in his book when he talks about real time music analysis.
      <br><br>
			The work by Basile is a webpage that features the ideas Jorge Luis Borges wrote about in his short story "The Library of Babel". This fiction presents a library in which every single book containing each and every possible combination of 1,312,000 characters is contained. Similarly, on the webpage, the user can look up any combination of up to 3200 characters and find it indexed in a library of all possible pages of 3200 characters. What is interesting to me with regards to my project is that in the Library of Babel there is no full index of all the pages: each part of the "library" is generated algorythmically upon request. However nothing is truely randomly generated either, as looking up the same phrase will always return the same result. In this way an illusion of infinity is created, although there is in this case a maximum number of combinations, 10^4677 books. I want to create a similar structure in my project, where the user pulls out part which are always the same out of an infinite pseudo-random whole.
