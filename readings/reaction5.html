				<br>GNU manifesto (1985)
				<br><br>In the GNU Manifesto Richard Stallman describes his intentions in
				creating and distributing GNU, how he will make it, why and what kind of
				impact he wants his work to have on society. I found especially interesting
				the final few paragraphs of the text in which he describes possible directions
				in which he could see society taking.
				<br> He envisions a world on track for
				"postscarcity", where technology enables everyone to work as little as
				ten hours in a week (on delightful tasks such as robot repairs and
				asteroid prospecting). He places programming as a free creative passtime
				for all and gives the professional programmer a place within every business.
				That is the world which free access to technology would bring!
				<br> <br>
				As I read this in 2018 it sounds kind of utopic. We are pretty darn far
				away from a world where tools or digital tools are freely accessible to
				everyone. I'm subscribed to Adobe CC for school, for gods sake! And I
				bought Ableton last year, after years of working with free (pirated)
				versions (shh).
				<br> I should add I purchased the "light" version as it lay
				within the range of my purchasing power, and in doing so lost access
				to much of useful tools I was used to using previously. Makes me sad!
				<br> I don't believe that sound engineers and programmers should work for
				free, but I do agree that making their crafts and tools public is an
				enabling act which allows anyone to create freely and in turn allows
				society to produce many, many more great ideas and realisations.
				<br>
				<br> It seems to me like in 1985 it's possible that the kind of future
				Stallman describes would not have been so far away. It's definately
				interesting to consider a point in time at which this future would
				have been only one choice away. The world isn't void of any options
				when it comes to free software however. <br> There's always free software
				for you to use out there, but it's usually of a quality lesser than
				the major proprietary softwares out there which fill the same function.
				For example Open Office (which I use) versus Microsoft Office. Some
				free programs I use work just great for their intended purpose, like
				processing, p5js, vvvv, paint.net, atom, vlc. I am not sure about
				the license of all of those, but some are definately open to contribution.
				<br> <br>
				Some major technology companies such as Google or Facebook have grown to
				gigantic proportions by offering a free-to-use service, and with time have
				created original business models that allowed them to maintain the bulk of
				their free services.
				<br> This reminds me of Stallman's attemps to portray an
				economy of the future, though the reality is completely off. While such
				companies innovate and make their trademark tools available for free,
				they often destructively in face of competition, and make the creation
				of cutting-edge tools a race in which the larger competitors are miles
				ahead of the smaller competitors.
				<br> <br>
				I found this manifesto especially eye-opening because of the perpsective
				it brings on the debate around the tightening of copyright laws nowadays.
				<br>
				Sure, people should be paid for their work, but I agree that the free
				dissemination of  technology and ideas enables the creation of true wonders,
				and would likely transform society in a profound manner.
				<br> Sure, people could be paid differently for their work
				(with something else than my personal information please).
				Is such a transformation possible? Would it ever? Who knows... Wouldn't it be great? Yes!
