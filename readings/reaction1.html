				<br><br>As We May Think by Vannevar Bush July 1945

				<br><br>	About a month before the a-bomb Vannevar Bush writes that science is good, in an interesting article on the challenges and possibilities related to then-emerging technologies which record, organise and transmit data.
				<br><br> In an almost Jules Vernes-like manner which I enjoy alot, he considers existing cutting-edge concepts using mechanical and electrical technologies and talks about future possibilities which may be extended from these brand new technologies. Like the french author, the future possibilities explored are in fact well educated guesses that display a certain level of  understanding of the current day's technology as well as theory; in fact many concepts described outline the functioning of modern technology, and in some cases the missing keystone is only a medium yet to be found.
				<br><br> Wearing my 21st century lenses I find it interesting to note which ideas discussed turn out to be accurate predictions on some levels, the ones which did not survive experimentation, and the challenges described that still exist today.
				<br><br>	Early in the article he states improved data recording technology leads to information surplus, and that the consequent need is to access information more rapidly. It is interesting to me that he, in the 1940s, felt like there was a surplus of information; secondly the conclusion he draws is still true. Part of the article explains in layman's terms the functionning of mechanical sorting and calculating, eventually leading to the conclusion (which he considers impossible) that complex logical systems such as games (poker, page 9) would have to be understood through pure mathematical logic; that data organisation should be researched until we can create a form of coherent thematic organisation (page 12) rather than simple numerical organisation.
				<br><br> He even describes a database which allows a user to create thematic links between scholarly articles, which I found very close to the original concept of html, and even the current form of Wikipedia. The complex logic machine also exists (example AlphaZero), though the author could not have predicted the implication of neural nets. The thematic database research tool also exists in many forms (web crawlers, recommentation systems).
				<br><br>	Bush accurately says that new professions would be built in the field of information gathering and sharing (nowadays there are engineers, programmers, and people using programs to create more). He writes that scholarly work would be propelled by information access, which is also true – little research can be done nowadays without a computer. He also notes that information access is someting that would simplify business, as well as everyday life.
				<br><br>	Other details I found interesting to consider was the mediums which Bush talked about. He has no concept of what digital data may be,as the technology of his time doesn't allow for it. He thinks only of punch cards and microfilms, and this dry photography thing which sounds horribly close to fax technology. Televisions at that time allow only to display information, saving it is a whole other issue. It's crazy to me how far he pushed his thought experiment while only following the hope that one could possibly make punch cards even smaller, and have them move faster from one place to another. There is no sign of digital media here, yet he describes e-books pretty much as they are today (page 13). To cover all of his accurate or innacurate proedictions I would have to re-write the entire article. Bush presents interesting visions using ideas that make only a small part of the technologies he describes. Interesting read, and I want a memex.
