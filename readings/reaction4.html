				<br><br>WEB WORK A HISTORY OF INTERNET ART
				<br>Here Rachel Greene explores examples of internet art during the 1990s. The first thing that strikes me is how much of this history is again very politically charged: however in this case we are not looking at government and military uses and control of the internet, but at commercial monopoly of the internet.
				<br>Internet art is presented as a direct resistance to the close mindedness of big business: the author brings forth examples of art for art's sake that emerge in the early 90s, examples of forums for free discourse on net art.
				<br>Perhaps this follows the line of 1980's counterculture philosophy we talked about in class.
				<br>Power struggles between individual artists and corporative interests are depicted. Net art is presented as a medium that goes hand in hand with political openness (the abundance of net art in early post-soviet Russia is given as an example though I think that's arguable; education in the technology sector was booming in the USSR in the 1980s as much as it was in the USA and that is also a reason why there would be net art in 1990s Russia). It is presented as a more or less successful platform for feminist discourse.
				<br>Aside from political discourse, the author also presents examples of net art! I like the distinction that is made between conceptual and visual net art, as the author states that visuals have nothing to do with the idea of net art.
				<br>I am reminded of a project I had stumbled upon last year called the library of babel that had really captured my imagination. Net art is a medium of its own when it allows for human-computer interactions specific to the net, not simply the viewing of visual arts on a screen.
				<br>User interaction and use of information supplied by the viewer/user/audience makes an important part of what is defined here as net art, as well as creative uses of web-specific design.
				<br>Another interesting note is the advent in the 1990s of web as a post-modern kind of medium: the web is established enough as a native medium to become something to break appart.
				<br>As the 2000s approach, net art becomes a much more established "thing", attracting government grants, attention from galleries. It ends by stating that "originally conceived as an alternative social field where art and everyday life were merged, net art may now seem threatened by its own success", as there is less room for an "antiestablishment spirit.
				<br>I'm not sure if that's true or if the internet had just become overloaded with information. Reaching large populations will always require time and money, and while it is deplorable that smaller projects will have an increasingly small place on the net, it may just be because it was a big world out there the whole time.
				<br>Greene closes by stating that we should continue to create and rebel. cheers to that!
