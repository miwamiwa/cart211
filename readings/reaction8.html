				Mind vs Machine
				<br><br>
				Brian Christian
				<br><br>
				Brian Christian writes a compelling narrative about his experience at
				the Loebner Prize competition and his anticipation regarding the event.
				I found it interesting to find out about the event, and to read about
				his thoughts and research on artificial intelligence.
				Moreso than the narrative itself I must say.
				<br> <br>
				He talks about what makes humans unique and goes on with some marxiam
				stuff about selfhood, and how computers are able to do everything that
				a human can do and more. <br> He seems to reference Stallman when he asks
				if the computer free us "from having to do a nonhuman activity,
				liberating us into a more human life" which I thought was interesting.
				Often the talk returns to questions about empathy, I suppose the
				theme of dehumanisation is important to Christian.
				<br><br>
				I thought it was also interesting to read about the early (1975)
				Eliza project and the reactions of the people of the time, who are
				amazed by the quality of conversation they are getting from a
				rudimentary artificial intelligence. I feel like I'm used to
				reading automated messages on social media, and public devices
				around the city all the time, and I think I've developed a certain
				awareness of some generic automated messages..
				<br>It does make you wonder how long until I get fooled consistantly
				into thinking an AI is actually a human being. I suppose they could
				be conviently dumbed down??
				<br><br>
				I thought the story about the swearing AI was pretty amazing.
				Also inspiring. There's an easy way to make a conversation with a
				àcomputer more lively right there (the applications of which are endless).
				<br><br>
				Loved the mention of cleverbot, which I remember messing around
				with in highschool. It sort of put Christian's end-of-the-world
				tone into perspective for me, since as I recall Cleverbot can't
				follow a conversation at all, only answer one-liners.
