				Video Games and Computer Hoding Power
				<br><br>
				I could appreciate a deeper look into the psychology of computer usage,
				finally, after all these comments about dehumanisation and loss of
				empathy woven into the last articles.
				<br>Also, while I would readily
				agree with the statement that computer holding power has absolutely
				nothing to do with video game narratives (in most cases), good
				narratives are needed for good visual arts, which I feel is an
				important factor in the appeal of a game. Though still, it could
				be argued that good visual arts also loop back into the point
				that video game holding power is somethin' else.
				<br><br>
				"more posessed by the game than playing it". I've always thought
				about video game addiction as being most likely a symptom of another
				problem, not the source of a problem in itself.
				<br><br>
				"a culture of rules and simulation"... where are we going with this?
				He talks about the process of learning how to automatize reflexes and
				movements in order to outdo oneself at a certain game, and relates it
				the piano, which I can totally relate to! On the piano however,
				repeating the same thing over and over for hours might be the process
				but oh boy is the feeling not at all the same - much more draining for
				the brain and easy to get distracted from.
				<br><br>
				Interestingly, I've had that same thought relating interaction with a
				computer, particularly but not limited to the context of video games,
				to a "conversation". To me, the computer is in fact a machine which
				responds to your input much like you would like a human to respond to
				input such as your questions, thoughts, musical riffs.. What I find is
				that a computer responds in a manner which one comes to anticipate
				and expect, and not be deceived by too often. Less often perhaps than
				nature which is full of unexpected events!
				<br>I've always understood
				that as being the more fulfilling aspect of computer interaction,
				that which makes users gravitate around their screen until 4am for
				no good reason. It reminds me quite vividly sometimes of being 13 years
				old and staying up as late as I could with good friends and not feeling
				the need to rest. Perhaps computers subtly bring you back to childhood..
				<br><br>I heard that's why cats like it when you pet them. Purr.
				<br><br>
				The author talks about enjoyement of highscores and feeling like a
				game adapts to your level of skill. He talks about kid Jarish's
				relationship with video games, and the contrast of euphoric and depressive
				feelings that surround it. He talks about his exaltation of the fantastic
				characters, and puts a good twist on the story when he talks about
				Jarish developping a passion for creative programming.
				<br><br>Finally, we
				get to the dangers of "infatuation with computer microworlds", like
				Narcissus and his reflection. "Most people don't become addicted to
				video games just as most people who diet don't become anorexic. But
				when they use these powerful mateirlas to measure themselves, they
				are at risk". 	<br> Sure! I can agree with both statements, I don't think
				video games are automatically a trap for your mental health, but
				having played and stopped playing games that can easily become a
				part of your ego (WoW for example), I feel like I've experienced
				both ends of that spectrum.
