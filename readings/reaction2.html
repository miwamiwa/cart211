		<br><br>Roy Rosenzweig – Review Essay : Wizards, Bureaucrats. Warriors, and Hackers : Writing the History of the Internet
		<br><br>	Rosenzweig's essay is interesting in that it presents a contrasted history of the internet by comparing a number of different sources.
		<br>The text presents various points of view, from writings hailing the implication of the US Department of Defense in the creation of ARPANET, to authors that elevate the work done at the bottom of the scale – programs and systems such as Usenet devised using existing technology pioneered by ARPANET that were instrumental democratizing the web and that transformed it into the tool for free circulation of information that it is today.
		<br>Rosenzweig makes a point to emphasize a duality between bottom-up and from-the-top influences that shaped the internet and identifies political and social currents that shaped these points of view.
		<br>He makes an interesting comparison of how different works present the « true » origin of the internet, and how often political reasons influence how the history itself is presented.
			<br><br>The first work explored is by Hafner and Lyon. Presented as a compelling narrative creating « cultural heroes », this work is critized by Rosenzweig for ignoring the political origins of networking research to instead focus on presenting the adventurous young men in play and the technicalities of the information systems they devised. Rosenzweig links the work of Larry Roberts on ARPANET to theories of Paul Baran on decentralized networking, stressing that the idea had been produced in direct response to Cold War scare.
			<br><br>Following is a work by Norberg and O'Neill which describes in more detail the rôle of the DoD. Interestingly, Rosenzweig points to the idea that before the internet existed, the DoD saw a practical need to create tools for rapid and centralized communications worldwide and thus had many reasons to fund such an entreprise, and that being said it is then more difficult to think that civil programmers, at home, would have predated the US military in implementing such systems before even witnessing the possible applications.
			<br><br>We reach the works of Paul Edwards. We are now exposed to views that birthed in american counterculture, and that denounce the controlling effects of US policies at home.
			<br>Edwards presents computer culture as a double edged sword which introduces new communication tools for the people, and a separate form of new tools for government as well, which helps shape and present political discourse in completely new ways. He points out the horrifying uses of technology in Vietnam. Rosenzweig uses this writing as grounds to steer his article towards exploring the duality between political and social currents, and counter culture elements that now shape the Internet as its use slowly becomes more widespread.
			<br><br>Rozensweig stops his history in the 1990's, as his essay was written in 1998. I would have liked to read more, but I must say the revisionist kind of approach that the author takes, enabled by a few years of hindsight, makes the history written here a thought inducing read.
