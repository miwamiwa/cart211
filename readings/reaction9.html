				GUI History
				<br><br>
				Jeremy Reimer
				<br><br>
				I didn't know much about the history of the GUI appart from rumours
				that said that Steve Jobs copied a bunch of dudes and became filthy
				rich. So I was glad to learn a bit about the history of the GUI.
				<br><br>
				As seems to be common place in these articles about computery matters,
				I noted that there is a parti pris as early as in the first page on
				the topic of whether or not people become less competant with computers
				("He envisionned the computer not as a replacement for human intellect,
				about a tool for enhancing it"). To Reimer that's a silent yes it seems.
				<br><br>
				I thought the history of the developments of the GUI to be interesting,
				but what struck me the most was how many similarities there are between
				the "mother of all demo", as Reimer puts it, and modern hardware. A
				keyboard, a mouse, a camera and remote connection, hypertext.. It was
				surprising for me to realise how little has changed in all this time,
				especially in an industry that is apparently so fast-paced. When I
				look at my laptop, I know it's much smaller and faster than what
				they used at Englebart's demonstration, but to me the similarities
				stand out much more than the differences. I suppose my laptop has a
				different mind of mouse too. And capacity for programs that Englebart
				didn't have, like music programs, drawing programs, etc. It has a
				(broken) touch screen too.
				<br><br>
				I suppose there have been some major changes in the industry, like
				touch screens and phone sized computers. We can connect all kinds of
				different devices with a computer too. Still my first reaction was to
				think about how much computers didn't change.
				<br><br>
				Nelson: Computer Lib, Dream Machines,
				<br><br>
				"first he argued that computer experiences were media to be designed
				<br><br>
				computers are simply a necessary and enjoyable partof life, like food and books.
				<br><br>
				a gap between people and computers, though computers are everywhere. I
				do understand where he's coming from on this. I've been raised all my
				life around computers so a certain extent, and still have never had
				any idea of how exactly they could work until after my childhood.
				While I've been able to draw and craft things to my liking with many
				different mediums, it was long until I really started to create
				things on a computer. Also when he talks about people complaining
				about computers, the first person I think about is my mom.
				The author brings forth very relatable concerns about the importance
				of knowing about technology and embracing it to its fullest potential.
				and makes a good point about it already being omnipresent in our lives.
				<br><br>
				Kay: Personal Dynamic Media
				<br><br>
				In a sense this is a nice extension to the History of the GUI
				article which talks about only very concrete applications of
				computers, and also ends its history with the mac OS X. I'm still
				impressed with how involved a printing company was with the creation
				of personal computers. <br>Printing started a revolution in the 15th c
				and so it would again in the 20th, huh! Also I noted in this article
				and the previous ones how early the importance of object oriented
				program was understood.
				<br><br>
				Reading about how the Dynabook could be hooked up to "organ-like
				keyboard for playing music" makes me want to try one of those so
				badly. I'm also kind of surprised that a printing company would
				venture into things that were not related to visual media. <br>I think
				this would be an indicator of some level of freedom in how the
				Dynabook's team was working which would probably please Roy Rosenzweig.
				I also gasped at the story of the 12 year old who wrote programs with
				Smalltalk and taught it to her friends. <br><br>"The imagination and boldness
				of the mid-1970s Dynabook vision" indeed! But to be honest that also
				brings me back to the idea that at the core computers and their
				applications haven't changed all the much despite their efficiency
				improving drastically.
